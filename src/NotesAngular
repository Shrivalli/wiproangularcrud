Angular is a framework
It helps to create SPA(Single Page Application)
We divide the page into Components
Every component will have 4 files: html,css,.ts(typescript), spec.ts(testing purpose)
Typescript gets converted into a javascript and it is loaded in the browser- Transpilation
app is the root component 
app.module.ts --> program.cs - startup file

Bindings in Angular
1. one way binding - interpolation {{variablename}} --> from .ts to html
2. two way binding  - ngModel  --> FormsModule in app.module.ts
3. Property binding
4. event binding - in html --> (click)="methodname"  ->defined in .ts

To generate a component:
ng g c compname
Take the selector of the new component and place it in appcomponent.html

Routing:
In app.routing.module.ts
1. const routes: Routes = [
  {path:'emplist',component:EmpListComponent},
  {path:'home',component:HomeComponent}
];

app.component.html
2. <a class="nav-link" routerLink="home">Home</a>

3. <router-outlet></router-outlet>

Services:
1. ng g s servicename

When the data has to be passed across components, create a service
Service is a class which has methods which can be invoked in all components
Inject the service object in the component's constructor

Angular Forms:
1. Template Driven Form - [(ngModel)] - html
2. Model Driven Form - Reactive Forms - .ts
